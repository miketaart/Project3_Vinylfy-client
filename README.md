## Vinylfy - Final Project Ironhack bootcamp
For my final project I created an app which lets you import and listen to your hardcopy vinyl collection by making use of the [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) Api (the largest online music database) and the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) Api. On the Frontend the requirement was to use the React library and on the backend I choose to use NodeJS and Express, MongoDB (MERN STACK APP). Click [https://github.com/miketaart/Vinylfy-server](here) to check out the server code

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.
