## Vinylfy - Final Project Ironhack bootcamp
For my final project I created an app which lets you import and listen to your hardcopy vinyl collection by making use of the [Discogs](https://www.discogs.com/) Api (the largest online music database) and the [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/) Api. On the Frontend the requirement was to use the React library and on the backend I choose to use NodeJS and Express, MongoDB (MERN STACK APP).
